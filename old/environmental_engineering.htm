                        <span class="i">Zuvic, Carr and Associates, Inc. (Zuvic 
						Carr)</span> has the knowledge and 
                        experience to conduct any phase of the investigative and 
                        remediation process. Let us assist you with the 
                        following activities:<p>
                       
                        <h5>Environmental Site Assessments</h5>To find out if a 
                        commercial or industrial property may present an 
                        environmental risk (typically before a sale), a Phase I 
                        environmental assessment is conducted, which is 
                        essentially a review of property and regulatory files, 
                        personnel interview, and a walk-over of the property. If 
                        potential spill or release areas are identified on the 
                        property, then a Phase II investigation (where soil and 
                        groundwater samples are collected for analysis) is 
                        typically performed. This may be followed by a delineation 
                        or Phase III investigation to evaluate the extent of 
                        contaminated soil and groundwater, and to determine if 
                        remediation is required.</p>
                        <p><h5>Remedial Action Plans</h5>
                        If a property requires remediation, 
                        <span class="i">Zuvic Carr</span> assesses and presents cost effective options 
                        designed to meet clean-up goals. We have experience with 
                        many remedial technologies, including excavation, soil 
                        vapor extraction, air sparging, and chemical oxidation. 
                        We also present accurate cost estimates for proper 
                        comparison and consideration.<p><h5>Design and Specification of Remedial 
                        Solutions</h5>
                        Once a remediation solution has been selected, design 
                        plans and specifications can be prepared for contractor 
                        use. Plans and specifications may be tailored either for 
                        public bidding purposes or as a design-build project&nbsp;if a specific contractor has already been selected.
                        <br>
&nbsp;<h5>Pre-Renovation or Demolition Surveys for Hazardous Materials</h5>
                        <span class="i">Zuvic Carr</span> conducts building inspections for lead, 
						asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) containing 
						materials.

                        Environmental Professional (LEP) Services</span></h5>
                        <span class="i">Zuvic Carr</span> provides LEP 
						services for a number of Connecticut programs, 
						including (but not limited to):<br>
&nbsp;<ul>
                          <li>Environmental investigations and remediation under 
                          the CT Transfer Act</li>
                          <li>Voluntary Cleanups and clean-up verifications 
                          (closure on behalf of the CT Department of Energy and 
                          Environmental Protection)</li>

                          storage tank (UST) systems under CT UST management

                        </ul>
                        <p><h5><span class="copybold">RCRA Site Closures</span> </h5>
                        When a hazardous waste generator has ceased operations, 
                        regulations require that the waste storage sites be 
                        tested and closed to specified standards. 
                        <span class="i">Zuvic Carr</span> prepares the necessary closure plans 
                        and supervises the decommissioning of these sites, from 
                        small quantity generator facilities to large quantity 
                        and transport-storage-and-disposal (TSD) facilities.<br>
